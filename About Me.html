    <br>
    <h2 class="paragraph">
        I am excited to express my enthusiasm and to share my journey of transitioning from a 15-year career in the healthcare industry to the dynamic world of web design and digital marketing.

        Driven by a passion for embracing the evolving landscape of modern skills, I made a deliberate choice to explore new horizons in technology. A pivotal moment came when I discovered the Tech-Moms course through a news article. Eager to equip myself with marketable skills aligned with the digital age, I enthusiastically enrolled and discovered a newfound passion for codingâ€”mastering HTML and CSS to craft captivating websites.
        
        My extensive tenure in healthcare empowered me with invaluable expertise in client interaction and relationship cultivation. I honed the art of understanding diverse client needs and fostering enduring connections, skills I'm eager to leverage in the tech realm. I firmly believe that effective communication, empathy, and a client-centric approach are universal pillars of success across industries.
        
        This transformative journey underscores my commitment to learning, adaptability, and the pursuit of excellence. I am excited to channel my skills and passion into a career that blends creativity, technology, and client-focused innovation.
        
        I am genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing my unique blend of healthcare-honed client relations and newly acquired tech expertise.
